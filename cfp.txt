Call for Proposals: SWIB21 online conference - 13th Semantic Web in Libraries Conference
29.11. - 3.12.2021, UTC 14:00-16:30
Submission Deadline: 28.06.2021

SWIB conference (Semantic Web in Libraries) is an annual conference, being held
for the 13th time.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we cannot be sure that travelling and meeting
face-to-face will be possible for everybody in the community by November. Therefore,
we have decided to hold SWIB21 the second time on the web. This will be an
opportunity to easily participate from all over the world.

Taking into account the different time zones of the participants, we plan to carry
out the conference during the week of 29 November - 03 December in the time from 
UTC 14:00 until 16:30.

SWIB focuses on Linked Open Data (LOD) in libraries and related organizations.
It is well established as an event where IT staff, developers, librarians, and
researchers from over the world meet and mingle and learn from each other. The
topics of talks and workshops at SWIB revolve around opening data, linking data
and creating tools and software for LOD production scenarios. These areas of
focus are supplemented by presentations of research projects in applied
sciences, industry applications, and LOD activities in other areas.

As usual, SWIB21 will be organized by the ZBW - German National Library of
Economics / Leibniz Information Centre for Economics and the North
Rhine-Westphalian Library Service Centre (hbz). The conference language is
English.

Would you like to share your experiences working on an interesting service,
research topic or project – not just what you did, but also how you did it?

For this SWIB rendition we adjusted the formats to the online environment:

- Presentations (15 minutes plus 5 q&a)
