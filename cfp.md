# SWIB24 – 16th Semantic Web in Libraries Conference

## 25 – 27 November 2024, online

## Call for Proposals

**Submission Deadline: 26 May 2024**

SWIB conference (Semantic Web in Libraries) is an annual conference, being held
for the 16th time. SWIB24 will happen online to ensure inclusion of as many
participants as possible while minimizing the ecological footprint of the conference.

SWIB focuses on Linked Open Data (LOD) in libraries and related organizations.
It is well established as an event where IT staff, developers, librarians, and
researchers from all over the world meet and mingle and learn from each other.
The topics of talks and workshops at SWIB revolve around opening data, linking
data and creating tools and software for LOD production scenarios. These areas
of focus are supplemented by presentations of research projects in applied
sciences, industry applications, and LOD activities in other areas.

As usual, SWIB24 will be organized by **[ZBW – Leibniz Information Centre for
Economics](https://www.zbw.eu/en)** and the **[North Rhine-Westphalian Library
Service Centre (hbz)](https://www.hbz-nrw.de/)**. The conference language is
English.

We are accepting proposals for two formats:

- Presentations (20 minutes plus 5 q&a)
- Practical workshops or tutorials (maximum 4h, including breaks), introductory tutorials are very welcome

The presentations will be held in the time from 14:00 to 17:00 UTC. **Note that we will support three different time slots for workshops to accommodate workshop facilitators and participants from different time zones (East Asia/Australia, Europe/Africa, Americas).**

We appreciate proposals on the following or related topics:

### Projects & Applications

* integration of LOD into productive library applications
* re-use of LOD (from libraries, Wikidata and other sources)
* presenting & visualizing LOD
* graphical user interfaces for interaction with LOD (e.g. editing or annotation)
* (other) applications in the context of open science

### Technology & Tools (focus on Open Source software)

* data transformation/integration/cleansing/enhancement/mapping/interlinking/validation
* data flow management, read/write linked data, providing updates & syncing data sources
* machine learning applications in/for libraries
* integration of symbolic and subsymbolic approaches

### Standards & Best Practices

* implementation of FAIR data principles, interoperability
* open web standards relevant for libraries, data models, usable APIs
* application profiles & provenance information
* working with controlled vocabularies & knowledge organization systems
* preservation, maintenance & sustainability

### Culture

* decentralization, federated structures
* consolidating open source projects
* collaboration, crowdsourcing, community building and empowerment
* diversity sensitivity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility

We are looking forward to receiving your proposals for presentations or
workshops by **26 May 2024**. Please submit an abstract of 1000–1500
characters using our conference system
