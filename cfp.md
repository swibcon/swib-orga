# SWIB23 – 15th Semantic Web in Libraries Conference

## 11 – 13 September 2023, Berlin

## Call for Proposals

**Submission Deadline (extended): 10 April 2023**

SWIB conference (Semantic Web in Libraries) is an annual conference, being held
for the 15th time. After three years of convening online due to the Covid-19 
pandemic, we are happy to gather in-person once again – and for the first time 
in Berlin.

SWIB focuses on Linked Open Data (LOD) in libraries and related organizations.
It is well established as an event where IT staff, developers, librarians, and
researchers from all over the world meet and mingle and learn from each other.
The topics of talks and workshops at SWIB revolve around opening data, linking
data and creating tools and software for LOD production scenarios. These areas
of focus are supplemented by presentations of research projects in applied
sciences, industry applications, and LOD activities in other areas.

As usual, SWIB23 will be organized by **[ZBW – Leibniz Information Centre for
Economics](https://www.zbw.eu/en)** and the **[North Rhine-Westphalian Library
Service Centre (hbz)](https://www.hbz-nrw.de/)**. The conference language is
English.

For this SWIB rendition we will have more interactive formats in order to get
the most out of participants coming together physically in one place.
As usual, we will also have presentations and workshops:

* presentations (20 minutes plus 5 q&a)
* practical workshops or tutorials (around 2–4 hours including breaks)

We appreciate proposals on the following or related topics:

### Projects & Applications

* integration of LOD into productive library applications
* re-use of LOD (from libraries, Wikidata and other sources)
* presenting & visualizing LOD
* end-user environments for interaction with LOD (e.g. editing or annotation)
* crowdsourcing/gamification approaches involving LOD sources
* applications for open science

### Technology (focus on Open Source software)

* data transformation/integration/cleansing/enhancement/mapping/interlinking
* data flow management
* RDF validation
* read/write linked data
* providing updates & syncing data sources
* machine learning for automatic indexing & named entity recognition
* integration of symbolic and subsymbolic approaches

### Standards & Best Practices

* implementation of FAIR data principles
* open web standards relevant for libraries
* application profiles & provenance information
* working with authorities & knowledge organization systems
* usable APIs
* preservation, maintenance & sustainability

### Culture
